## Flight Accidents Analysis

### Overview
This project focuses on analyzing flight accidents data with a dataset sourced from 'Airplane_Crashes_and_Fatalities_Since_1908.csv'. The analysis delves into aviation accidents, fatalities, and trends over the past century. The main objective is to provide a comprehensive understanding of historical flight safety, with a specific emphasis on visualizing accident counts by country and decade.

### Features

- Utilizes PySpark and Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
- Harnesses SpaCy and LocationTagger to extract location information from textual data.
- Employs Seaborn for data visualization, producing a swarm plot of country names vs. the decade range with accident counts.

### Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure you have the required Python3 libraries installed. You can do this by running:
pip install pyspark pandas spacy locationtagger seaborn

3. **Running the Analysis**: Run the main analysis code file (`Frequency_of_Crash.ipynb`) to perform data processing and generate visualizations.

4. **Exploring the Output**: Explore the generated swarm plot (`output.png`) to observe accident counts by country and decade. The dataset used is available in 'Airplane_Crashes_and_Fatalities_Since_1908.csv' for further analysis.
